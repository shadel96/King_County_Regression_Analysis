    "In order to help a new real estate company in King County, we need to analyze past house sales data in the region and create a linear regression model which can help the company better understand what factors contribute to price of a given home. We will import just over 21 thousand data points from recent sales in the King County area, and proceed to clean, preprocess, and model the information present in this dataset in order to inform the new company on how to appropriately assess the value of a home when helping a client buy or sell a home."
