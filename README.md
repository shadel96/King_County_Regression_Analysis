## Overview

In order to help a new real estate company in King County, we will use analyis of recent house sales data to inform  decisions on how to accurately assess the value of a given property for future buyers and sellers. Using key points of data from other house sales, we will help the new company utilize a more data-driven approach than competitors. With the help of this analysis, the company will be able to determine what features of a property have the most statistically significant impact on it's value, and what steps can be taken going forward to accurately price houses in the area.
